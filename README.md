## **1 | Overview and Origin**

### **1.1 Overview**
Stripe Inc ('Stripe') is fintech company specialising in digital checkout processing solutions. Stripe is in the payments/billing domain. Its main service offering, Stripe Payments, allows merchants to accept payments online and via its mobile applications. Formed in 2010 by brothers, Patrick and John Collison,Stripe has become one of the biggest providers of payment software services and solutions in the United States[^1].

A link to its website can be accessed [here](https://stripe.com/au?utm_campaign=908244709&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_content=301607044450&utm_term=stripe&utm_matchtype=e&utm_adposition=&utm_device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhMOMBhDhARIsAPVml-Gh7oJjTmrWXyCz39osWeueaZXjH57OLiPydXk4YgVozPRxtVtX3xIaAmdBEALw_wcB). 

### **1.2 Company Philosophy**
Stripe's mission is to ['increase the GDP of the internet'](https://stripe.com/au/about). Patrick Collison said in an interview that ['Google Checkout and PayPal are these confusing things, and we wondered why they hadn’t solved these issues'](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/stripe-teardown/). John and Patrick Collison were frustrated with the byzantine protocols to accepting online payments. Stipe intends to streamline for its e-commerce customers and build a developer-focused, instant setup payment platform that any company could use and scale.

### **1.3 Funding Streams**
The company has received a total of [$USD2.235bn in 21 funding rounds](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stripe), valuing Stripe at [$USD95bn](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/under-the-hood-a-closer-look-at-stripe-the-most-highly-valued-venture-backed-private-company-in-the-us/#:~:text=Payments%20processing%20startup%20Stripe%20earlier,its%20Series%20H%20funding%20round). This makes it the most valuable privately-owned tech company in the world. Stipe is predominately funded via venture financing and receives [funding from high‐profile private equity investors](https://www.businessinsider.com/stripe-financials-2020-revenue-1-36-billion-2021-10?r=US&IR=T#:~:text=Citing%20sources%2C%20the%20Wall%20Street,year%20revenue%20of%20%2422%20billion) including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. The following table summarises Stripe's funding over the [last five years](https://www.stripepreipo.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAys2MBhDOARIsAFf1D1epdSNYtHOJWMZdhfVeRPE4F_5J7Y9v7TFBgxGp_GxSm2rmq5tEnk0aApeAEALw_wcB).

| Year | Raise | Total Funds Received |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 2017 | - |  $USD440m |
| 2018 | $USD245m | $USD685m |
| 2019 | $USD350m | $USD1.035bn |
| 2020 | $USD600m | $USD1.635bn |
| 2021 | $USD600m | $USD2.235bn |

## **2 | Business Activities**

### **2.1 Company Vision and Mission**

 Digital commerce businesses must interact with numerous financial institutions process multi-sided payments, onboard and verify merchants, provide tax paperwork. John and Patrick Collison found that payment infrastructure built around these institutions were not designed to support large quantities of transactions between complex interdependencies across countries, which are now key for internet businesses to thrive.[^2]

 [^2]: Stripe, 'Our mission is to increase
the GDP of the internet' (Web Page) < https://stripe.com/au/about>.

 Stripe understands that outdated financial infrastructure plagued with coding and design issues hinder the progress of the internet economy. 
 
Patrick Collison noted in an [interview](http://rev.vu/Va2Rj3?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=share&utm_medium=email&utm_source=MIND+%26+MACHINE+Newsletter):
> The internet is nitrogen fertilizer. ... [Stripe wants to] unlock all sorts of entrepreneurship and economic activity that wouldn't otherwise have occurred.

Stripe intends to resolve the complexities of online payment processing with an integrated ecosystem across the value chain, designed for an exceptional user experience. Since, Stripe expanded its offerings to a suite of services intended to give entrepreneurs access to the building blocks that help in starting a global internet business, including fraud detection and identity verification.

### **2.2 Target Customer Segment and Market Size**

 Stripe is only available to business users, with target customers ranging from SMEs to large multinationals. It has a customer base that includes Amazon, Uber, OpenTable, Salesforce, and Rackspace. The global B2B payment transactions market was valued [$USD870.42bn](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/global-b2b-payments-market-reach-094600864.html) in 2020. Currently, Stripe has a [16.17% market share](https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/payment-processing--26/square-payments-market-share). 

### **2.3 Unique Selling Point and Value Propositions**

Stripe differentiates itself from its competitors in three main ways:

#### *Robust APIs and strong developer focus*
Stripe customers [reported](https://stripe.com/files/payments/IDC_Business_Value_of_Stripe_Platform_Full%20Study.pdf) that they can build and extend their online payments platforms much more efficiently with Stripe than with alternatives. Stripe’s API and documentation saves users’ engineering time, at the time of launch and maintenance of integrations over time. Other payment processing companies have complex APIs with different permissions (classic APIs such as Adaptive Payments, Adaptive Accounts, Merchant APIs, etc.), however, ease of set setup, integration and maintenance places Stripe ahead of its competitors.[^3] For example, Stripe enables user to stay on the merchant site when making a payment, instead of being redirected to another site. 

[^3]: Leeron Hoory and Cassie Bottorff, 'PayPal Vs. Stripe Comparison 2021' *Forbes Advisor* (Web Page, 28 September 2021) < https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/paypal-vs-stripe/>.

#### *Enhanced data security*
Stripe enables users to accept payments in a PCI compliant manner. Stripe.js is Stripe’s foundational library for securely sending sensitive information to Stripe directly from the customer’s browser bypassing user’s server, thereby preventing theft of credit card data.[^4]

[^4]: Mike Dahn, 'A guide to PCI compliance' (Web Page) <https://stripe.com/en-au/guides/pci-compliance >.

#### *Powerful Dashboard and Fast Interface*
Stripe’s interface is fast and provides useful data analytics for users. For example, it provides instant type-ahead search over all client data and display bank transfers and HTTP request.[^5] Further, its interface provides graphs and charts, making data comprehensible and clear. By contrast, PayPal users often experience issues with the account management interface. Performing functions, such as refunding transactions is often time-consuming and difficult to navigate.[^6]

[^5]: See, 'Build your pixel‑perfect payments experience' *Stripe Elements* (Web Page) <https://stripe.com/au/payments/elements >.

[^6]: See eg, DoNotPay, 'Chargebacks and Refunds: How to Get a PayPal Refund' (Web Page) < https://donotpay.com/learn/paypal-refund>.

#### *A single innovative all-encompassing service*
The payments technology market is a competitive space. However, Stripe's breadth of offerings, ability to partner with other businesses gives it better reach, making it efficient at scaling payments in the market.[^7] While most payments vendors focus on offering products that satisfy a specific commerce need, Stripe offers a broader solution by positioning itself as a platform where businesses can build their entire digital commerce strategy. 

[^7]: Maria Albonico et al, *The 2020 McKinsey Global Payments Report* (Report, October 2020).

#### **2.4 Product Offerings and Technologies Involved**

Stripe has launched several additional revenue streams, pivoting from its core payments business. Stripe uses 66 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery. This case study focuses on three Stripe services.[^8]

[^8]: Crunch Base, 'Stripe' (Web Page) < https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stripe/technology>.

*Stripe Identity*

[Stripe Identity](https://stripe.com/au/identity) is a verification tool for businesses to identify customers and help prevent fraud Stripe Identity uses **machine learning** to match a user-uploaded photo of their government-issued ID with a user’s live video selfie within 15 seconds.[^9]

[^9]: Stripe, 'Stripe Identity' (Web Page) < https://stripe.com/au/identity>.

It is available in a low-code format, which allows organisations without advanced coding skills to set up their own tool based on Stripe’s technology.[^10] An off-the-shelf version is also available that requires no coding from businesses and involves fraud and risk teams generating verification links to assess suspicious transactions.[^11]

*Stripe Payments*

Stripe Payments is Stripe's core offering . It is an end-to-end payment platform for online marketplaces, e‐commerce retailers and other businesses. The two most [common programming languages](https://techstacks.io/stacks/stripe/) used on this platform are **Ruby** and **JavaScript**. Ruby is used predominately for Stripe's back-end services including the Stripe dashboard, API and website.

[Server libraries](https://techstacks.io/stacks/stripe/) are facilitated thorough Sinatra and [client libraries](https://techstacks.io/stacks/stripe/) are stored on Backbone.js and React. [Stripe's databases and NoSQL Datastores](https://techstacks.io/stacks/stripe/) are PostgreSQL, Hadoop and Redis. [Stripe's cloud and hardware infrastructure](https://techstacks.io/stacks/stripe/) are housed on AWS.

*Railyard*

Railyard is an Kubernetes-powered API and job manager for training machine learning models. Stripe defines a ['framework-agnostic workflow'](https://stripe.com/blog/railyard-training-models) and Railyard workflow provides an API contract for users. It allows for an increasing count of models and increasingly large datasets. Railyard provides a JSON API and is a Scala service that manages job history, state, and provenance in a Postgres database. Kubernetes serves as Railyard's execution engine for all of the model training runs.[^12]

## **3 | Competitive Landscape**

### **3.1 Industry Trends and Innovations in Payment Processing from 2010–2021?**

Five key developments in the last ten years have emerged.

*Cloud Technology is Universally Adopted*

Cloud technology has been widely adopted across most payment companies. Companies with their own proprietary cloud systems are now the main providers for banks looking to improve their systems.[^13] Banks are processing and storing growing amounts of data. Migrating to the cloud can significantly reduce data management costs.

Further, building and implementing machine learning systems and POS software all involve cloud technology. Adopting cloud-based software allows companies to increase transaction and reconciliation speed to offer better payments experience.[^14]

[^13]: *Consumer Payments: Trends and opportunities for payments providers* (Marketline Case Study, May 2016).

[^14]: Ibid.

#### *Growth of Social Commerce*

There is a growing social commerce market. Whilst, this movement has been subtle in Australia, social networks in Asia (such as LINE and WeChat) have made considerable progress.[^15] For example, WeChat users can buy instantly within the chat app. This extends to booking taxis, flights, and doctor appointments, pay bills, make P2P payments, get directions, order food, shop, and read articles. A built in mobile payments platform which enables both online and in-store payments is a feature rather than a separate action.[^16] Stripe itself has already struck deals with Twitter and Facebook to begin offering services via their respective marketplaces.

[^15]: *Payments & Transactions: Companies investing in the 10 key themes will dominate the payments industry* (Marketline Case Study, June 2021).

[^16]: Ibid.

*Payments Sector Embracing M&A to Grow Geographically*

As the market becomes mature, fintech competition intensifies. Consolidation through a series of mergers and acquisitions has grown. Established fintechs are absorbing other emerging fintechs or established ones to augment their capabilities, expand services and adopt innovation faster.[^17]

[^17]: *Fintech Consolidation process in the sector as large players move in* (Marketline Theme Report, March 2020).
 
An increasing number of countries are attracting attracting large deals, including acquisitions in:[^18]

[^18]: Ashwin Alexander et al, *The 2021 McKinsey Global Payments Report* (Report,October 2021).

| Country | Company | Acquisition Value |
| ------- | --------| ----- | 
| USA | Paya | $1.3bn |
| USA | Chime | $530m |
| Sweden | Klarna | $650m |
| UK | Revoult | $580m |
| Poland | Polskie ePlatnosc | $587m |

However, there is a risk where lock of solution scalability leads to duplicating solutions, and unnecessary technology overhead. This will have trickle down effects of lowering efficiency and interference with acquirers’ ability to serve merchants across borders.

*Increasing Focus on 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services*

Job insecurity and unemployment brought about by the COVID-19 Pandemic is expected to continue into the forseeable future. An increased demand for payment flexibility and low-cost credit for consumers struggling financially has emerged. This saw the advent of 'buy now pay later' services. Recently, Stripe has partnered with Klarna to boost revenues and increase customer conversions among Stripe’s business partners. Customers shopping on the relevant platforms will be able to select Klarna’s 'buy now, pay later' option at the checkout.

*Enhanced Focus on Open Banking Related Opportunities*

Opening gives consumers to [securely share their selected banking data with accredited third parties](https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/financial-services/articles/open-banking.html). This will enable third-party developers to build applications and services around the financial institution. These embedded financial services have become an increasingly popular offering big tech platform companies and other non-financial services companies. For example, in 2020 Stripe partnered with Goldman Sachs, Evolve Bank & Trust, Barclays and Citigroup to provide embedded financial and payments capabilities to users via their platform, known as [Stripe Treasury](https://stratechery.com/2020/stripe-platform-of-platforms/). The object is to create a bank-partner network in which the platform will fulfill compliance and regulatory requirements in partnership with its banking partners.

### **3.2 Competitors**
In payments processing, the largest players include:[^19]
* PayPal
* Adyen, Klarna
* FattMerchant
* VeriFone
* Fiserv
* Square Payments
* Shopify Payments

[^19]: *Global Financial Technology Market* (Marketline Company Report, March 2021).

## **4 | Company Performance**

### **4.1 Business Impact**

The weight of Stripe's business impact is realised in its ability to streamline inefficiencies and provide a more flexible and robust payments platform for its users. Stripe handles all of e-commerce transaction flows. This means there is no need to create an new infrastructure or integrate non-Stripe services.[^20]

[^20]: Marketline, *Stripe Inc* (Master Company Report, November 2021).

A [survey](https://stripe.com/files/payments/IDC_Business_Value_of_Stripe_Platform_Full%20Study.pdf) of Stripe customers found that 66% of online transaction of their online payments transactions, equate to $USD40.15m per year on average, were conducted via Stripe. This means that almost half of these users' total revenue rely Stripe platforms.

[On average](https://stripe.com/files/payments/IDC_Business_Value_of_Stripe_Platform_Full%20Study.pdf), Stripe services result in:
* 6.7% higher revenue;
* 59% higher developer productivity;
* 24% lower cost of building/operating online payments platform; and
* 81% fewer unplanned outages.

Platforms and marketplaces that use Stripe have reportedly achieved a [**364% ROI**](https://stripe.com/au/reports/forrester-tei-2018). The functionality of the Stripe payments platform has resulted in an increased customer base and revenue growth.

#### **4.2 Performance Metrics**
Stripe is a payments processing company. Relevant metrics companies of the same type use to measure performance include:
* gross profit margin;
* yearly revenue;
* year over year revenue growth; 
* number of active merchant users;
* payment volume processed;
* market share; and
* overall company valuation.

#### **4.3 Performance Relative to Competitors**

The following table compares the above metrics against Stripe's [three competitors](https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/payment-processing--26/stripe-market-share).

|           | Stripe | PayPal | Shopify Payments | Square Payments |
| ---------| ------ | ------ |------- |--------------- |
| **Gross profit margin** | 38% | 46.62% | 54.19% | 24.2% |
| **Yearly Revenue (2020)**| $2.5bn | $21.45bn | $2.1bn | $9.48bn | 
| **Year over year revenue growth (2019–2020)** | 25% | 20.72% | 85.63% | 101.5% |
| **Number of active merchant users** | 3.1m | 20m | 1.75m | 2m |
| **Payment volume processed** | $350bn | $936bn | $20.5bn | $28.2bn |
| **Market share** | 16.17% | 49.28% | 10.16% | 1.11% 
| **Overall company valuation** | $95bn | $336bn | $106.5bn | $110bn

Stripe ranks the following based on the above metrics:

| Metric | Rank |
| ---- | -----|
| **Gross profit margin** | 2 |
| **Yearly Revenue (2020)** | 3 |
| **Number of active merchant users** | 2 |
| **Payment volume processed** | 2 |
| **Market share** | 2 |
| **Year over year revenue growth (2019–2020)** | 3 |
| **Overall company valuation** | 4 |

Stripe is not the highest performing company based on the above metrics, however, its undeniably a leader in its industry. The increasing rate of innovation and adoption of digital payment solutions has seen the market mature. In response, Stripe has consolidated through mergers and acquisitions, absorbing other emerging fintechs to augment their capabilities and expand its services.[^21] However, these deals have not translated into recorded profits. Stripe is well-positioned to profit from those coming changes. The above metrics will increase to reflect that growth.

[^21]: Ibid.

Stripe's comparatively lower rankings may also be contributed to the fact that it is still a private company. PayPal, Shopify and Square Payments are all public companies able to raise **significant** funds **quickly** through the sale of company shares to the public. Whereas Stripe is limited to fundraising privately.

#### **4.4 How Does Stripe Compete?**

Starting as a payment processor, Stripe's success is grounded in offering merchants simplicity and ease of transactions within the complex ecosystem of online payments.[^22] This was a viable strategy ten years ago to capture market share. However, intense competition raises concerns about whether Stripe can preserve its dominance. There is now a premise that payment processing should be easy (ironically pioneered by Stripe, itself). This section assesses Stripe initiatives to compete.

[^22]: Ibid.

*Extending Geographic Reach*

Over the years, Stripe builds scale across geographies and to enhance their suite of capabilities to stay competitive in the face of next-generation merchant-services platforms. They have made acquisitions of foreign companies including:[^23]
* Recko Software: India-based payments reconciliation software provider; and
* Paystack:Nigeria-based online and offline payments processing company;

[^23]: Ibid.

These deals, amongst others complete Stripes ambition to the customise and cover practically every process of the online payment experience **worldwide**. Stripe is available in 46 countries. However, it falls short of Paypal, which operates in over 200 countries.[^24]

[^24]: Marketline, *PayPal* (Master Company Report, November 2021).

*Diverse Product offerings and Entry into New Markets*

Stripe's aggressive venture capital activities target specific industries by building solutions that cater to their needs. Notable acquisitions include:[^25]
* TaxJar (provider of cloud-based suite of tax services);
* Touchtech Payments (provider advanced strong customer authentication technology);
* Index Systems (provider of retail software and personalised marketing)
* Tiemp Labs (web-based tax and contractor payments service provider); and
* Bouncer (US-based card authentication company).

[^25]: Marketline, *Stripe Inc* (Master Company Report, November 2021).

However, this kind of growth is quickly leading to saturation as most of the developed markets that they are building for are already close to full capacity.

*Strong Relationships in the Developer Community*

Stripe set-up requires developer knowledge.[^26] On the other hand, its chief competitor, PayPal offers a setup does not require advanced technical knowledge. However, rather than compromising customisation for ease, Stripe focused specifically on developers who experienced difficulties handling payments. Stripe solved this problem with ahe easy setup, the powerful API, and extensive documentation, using as few lines of code as possible. Strong relationships and awareness in the developer community has translated into a growth loop centered on word of mouth.[^27] Essentially, build a community around the product has elevated Stripe's credibility to a level that competitors have not achieved through traditional marketing strategies. 

[^26]: Marketline, *Stripe Inc* (Master Company Report, November 2021).

## **5 | Recommendations**

### **5.1 Stripe Chatbot Based Robo-advisors to Improve Use Experience** 

Many Stripe users have [reported negative feedback and reviews](https://au.sitejabber.com/reviews/stripe.com) about Stripe on the major social media platforms. Stripe has the lowest rating in terms of customer support. This is surprising considering that Stripe has always branded itself as customer-centric and focused on delivering optimal customer experiences. While, these comments do not directly threaten Stripe's business, retention rate and credibility may suffer. 

Therefore, it would be ideal to introduce advanced [chatbot based robo-advisors](https://chatbotslife.com/chatbot-based-robo-advisors-the-best-ai-can-do-currently-to-help-retail-investors-5800649c88c3) to:
1. be integrated into the Stripe platform; and/or
2. perform back-office functions to support Stripe staff independently.

However, this recommendation is not without risks. Incomplete client profiling due to poorly designed data capture mechanisms, or incomplete information provided by the customer can severely impact the robo-advisor’s ability to provide optimum recommendations. Further, depending on the degree of interaction, a robo-advisor may not be effective at holding a single conversation with multiple queries or contexts simultaneously.

It is intended that this will be a hybrid service where a robo-advisor works in tandem with human advisors to resolve issues. While, robo-advisors have typically been used in wealth management and investing. Ultimately, there is no single commonly accepted definition of robo-advice.[^28] Robo services provide advice based on algorithms. Therefore, a robo-advice proposition where actionable advice is recommended to Stripe users to set up and use the platform is [not fanciful](https://www.credenceanalytics.com/whitepapers/Chat-based-Robo-Advisors-A-Game-changer-in-the-banking-space.pdf).[^29]

[^28]: See also Marketline, *The future of artificial intelligence in banking AI will impact and transform the banking sector* (Report, July 2017).

[^29]: See Marketline, *Robo-advice: Empowering individuals to make better financial decisions* (Report, April 2018).

### **5.2 Benefits of Stripe Chatbot Based Robo-advisors**

Stripe supports its customers through email, phone and 24/7 human support. Currently, internal tools, teams and protocols are used to handle complex requests.[^30] This results in delays in resolution up to 1–3 days.

[^30]: Sourced from a conversation between the author and a Stripe representative.

Implementing an advanced virtual assistant would:
* result in quicker resolution times;
* accurately detect user intent and drive contextual conversations using AI; and
* Enable self-serve support and automate repetitive queries seamlessly

This would translate into improved user experience in three ways.

*Higher Customer Satisfaction and Retention Rates*

The assistant can work with Stripe staff to develop a more effective triage system to diagnose technical issues. Sophisticated robo-advisors could even replace human staff and automate the entire customer support process. Even staff with less technical expertise could handle complex technical issues independently. Sophisticated chatbots have achieved a [72% resolution rate](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/accelerating%20winds%20of%20change%20in%20global%20payments/2020-mckinsey-global-payments-report-vf.pdf) (no further interaction required), allowing the firm to reduce demand for agent assistance by 22%. Decreased time spent trouble shooting will generate higher customer satisfaction rates. 

*Improving Ease of Set-up and Onboarding*

SME merchants prioritise [ease of use and setup](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/accelerating%20winds%20of%20change%20in%20global%20payments/2020-mckinsey-global-payments-report-vf.pdf) and are ready to change providers for better technology.

Robo-advisors can lead to a competitive advantage in the industry. Currently, Stripe's ease of set-up is comparatively lower than PayPal.[^31] A robo-advisor designed to assist the custom Stripe integration can attract those with little to none developer knowledge. Having someone who could guide and assist users towards a self-managed solution adds value.

[^31]: Marketline, *PayPal* (Master Company Report, November 2021).

*Improving Ease of Use*

Robo-advisors can monitor customer behaviour and preference over time to increase ease of use.[^32] The previous stored customer interactions will provide a wealth of data to train the model. For example, robo-advisors can collect data for points where users have experienced set-up difficulties and improve their source code to those streamline inefficiencies. 

[^32]: Sai Kiran Reddy, 'Chatbot based robo-advisors — The best AI can do currently to help retail investors?' (Web Page, 15 April 2021) < https://chatbotslife.com/chatbot-based-robo-advisors-the-best-ai-can-do-currently-to-help-retail-investors-5800649c88c3#:~:text=So%20the%20best%20thing%20AI,called%20chatbot%20based%20robo%2Dadvisors>.

### **5.3 Technologies Involved and Suitability**

Currently, robo-advice is limited, operators still have complete control over the type of advice, and programs of lower complexity default to providing generic recommendations, disregarding user requests. However, advancements in natural language processing and machine learning may produce [higher quality targeted advice](https://www.whoson.com/chatbots-ai/the-rise-of-the-online-robo-advisor/#:~:text=For%20other%20customer%20services%2C%20chatbots,%2Dadvisors%2C%20consider%20sales%20chatbots). 

This primarily relies on two technologies: (1) natural language processing and (2) machine learning.

First, natural language processing extracts meaning from human language to make decisions based on the information. This will enable the robo-advisor to to understand user queries and respond to questions adequately, automatically, and in real-time without human assistance. The objective is to reach a point where the robo-advisor is indistinguishable from a live agent. Second, through machine learning, robo-advisors will begin to understand intent by tracking how users respond to the answers they provide. They will learn and improve over time. Stripe should leverage machine learning to understand each individual and create a unique 'persona', based on their business type, user behaviour, preferences and commercial objectives.[^33]

[^33]: Credence Analytics, *Chat based Robo-Advisors: A Game changer in the banking space* (White Paper).

This would be supplemented by a combination of modules that may include language detection, ASR classification, context manager.[^34] These work in tandem with deep learning-based encoders to accurately understand natural language and handle user queries with higher precision. In-built contextual spell corrector, adversarial training, context retention can further improve bot accuracy.
